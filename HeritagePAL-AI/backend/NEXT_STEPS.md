# Next Steps for HeritagePAL-AI

We've successfully resolved several issues with the HeritagePAL-AI application. Here's a summary of what we've fixed and what you need to do next.

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ **Missing Dependency**: Installed the required `express-async-handler` package.
2. ✅ **Authentication System**: Updated the code to use Supabase authentication instead of JWT.
3. ✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in controllers and middleware.
4. ✅ **Database Schema**: Created migration scripts to support the new authentication system.
5. ✅ **Temporary Workarounds**: Added code to handle the password field issue until database migration is completed.

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Database Migrations**:
   - Follow the instructions in `DATABASE_MIGRATION.md` to run the SQL scripts in the Supabase SQL Editor.
   - This will fix the password field constraint issues and create necessary RPC functions.

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct Supabase URL and API keys.
   - The application will validate these on startup.

3. **Test User Registration and Authentication**:
   - After running the migrations, try creating a new admin and user account.
   - Test login functionality to ensure tokens are working correctly.

4. **Monitor for Any Other Issues**:
   - The application includes improved error logging to help identify problems.
   - Check the server logs if you encounter any issues.

## Frontend Updates

The frontend is now running with the new authentication system. The key changes include:

1. Using Supabase session tokens instead of JWT.
2. Improved login and registration flows.
3. Better error handling for authentication failures.

## Documentation

We've created several helpful documents to assist with the migration:

- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`: Complete guide to setting up Supabase for this application.
- `DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`: Instructions for migrating the database schema.
- `backend/src/db/*.sql`: SQL scripts for database migrations and fixes.

## Future Improvements

Once the current issues are resolved, consider these future improvements:

1. **Remove Temporary Workarounds**: After migrations are complete, you can clean up the temporary code we added.
2. **Enhanced User Management**: Add functionality for password reset, email verification, etc.
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Enhance the admin and user role system.
4. **Security Audit**: Conduct a thorough review of the authentication system.

Please let me know if you encounter any other issues during the migration process.
